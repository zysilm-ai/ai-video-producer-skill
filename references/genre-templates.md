## Using Genre Templates

### In scene-breakdown.md

Add the genre to your Overview section:

```markdown
## Overview
- **Total Duration**: 30 seconds
- **Number of Scenes**: 5
- **Video Type**: Narrative
- **Genre**: fantasy
- **Pipeline Mode**: Scene/Segment v3.0
```

### Mixing Genres

Videos often blend genres. Prioritize the primary genre but borrow techniques:

| Primary | Secondary | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Action | Horror | Survival horror with chase sequences |
| Drama | Fantasy | Character-driven fantasy story |
| Comedy | Action | Action comedy with pratfalls |

Use the primary genre's pacing and the secondary's techniques where appropriate.

### When to Deviate

These are guidelines, not rules. Deviate when:
- The narrative moment requires it
- Brand guidelines specify different approaches
- The specific shot calls for an exception

Always prioritize what serves the story over rigid genre rules.
