## Pipeline Notes

### Product Photography Principles
- **Hero Shot (Scene 1)**: Product alone, clean background, professional lighting
- **Detail (Scene 2)**: Macro-level quality indicators, material, texture, craftsmanship
- **Context (Scene 3)**: Aspirational use, real integration, emotional connection

### Lighting Strategy
- Scene 1: Three-point professional studio lighting
- Scene 2: Dramatic accent lighting (side or back) for texture
- Scene 3: Warm natural lighting, lifestyle feel

### Motion Guidelines
- Commercial genre uses **slower, more deliberate motion**
- Orbits and push-ins should be smooth and unhurried
- Person interaction should feel natural, not performative

### Adapting This Template

**For Tech Products:**
- Scene 1: Product floating or on minimal stand
- Scene 2: Screen detail, port close-ups, material transitions
- Scene 3: User at desk, in meeting, or mobile

**For Food/Beverage:**
- Scene 1: Hero pour or plating
- Scene 2: Texture, ingredient close-ups
- Scene 3: Enjoyment moment, social setting

**For Fashion:**
- Scene 1: Product on form or styled flat lay
- Scene 2: Fabric texture, hardware details
- Scene 3: Worn in aspirational context

### This Example Demonstrates
- Commercial genre pacing (consistent 5s segments)
- Dissolve transitions for smooth flow
- Product-centered (landscape) to lifestyle (character) progression
- Hero → Detail → Context narrative structure
- Clean backgrounds with purpose
- Aspirational tone without being artificial
