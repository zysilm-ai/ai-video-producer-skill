## Pipeline Notes

### Pacing Strategy
- This example uses variable duration (3-5s) following action genre guidelines
- Short setup (3s) - action movies start fast
- Peak tension gets longest segment (5s) - earn the payoff
- Resolution quick and satisfying (4s)

### Camera Energy
- Tracking shots throughout for kinetic feel
- Camera should feel like it's running too
- Handheld energy in prompts where appropriate

### Motion Prompts Emphasis
- Use active verbs: sprints, vaults, weaves, bursts, leaps
- Include physical details: arms pumping, legs driving
- Environmental interaction: pedestrians dodge, produce scatters

### This Example Demonstrates
- Action genre pacing (3-5s variable segments)
- Smash cut usage for sudden obstacles
- Tracking camera language
- Tension arc: spotted → pursuit → obstacles → trapped → escape
- Beat types showing narrative function
- Physical action verbs in motion prompts
