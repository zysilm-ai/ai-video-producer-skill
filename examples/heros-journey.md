## Pipeline Notes

### Visual Consistency
- Maintain hero's cloak color and style across all scenes
- Weather progression: dawn (1) → morning (2) → overcast (3-4) → golden breakthrough (5)
- Hero should show increasing weathering but maintained silhouette

### Motion Emphasis
- Scene 1: Minimal motion, contemplative
- Scene 2: Purposeful forward movement
- Scenes 3-4: Physical struggle and effort
- Scene 5: Triumphant stillness with environmental motion (wind, light)

### This Example Demonstrates
- Three-act structure in miniature
- Variable segment duration (4-6s based on moment type)
- Genre-appropriate pacing (fantasy epic)
- Beat type usage (setup → action → resolution)
- Transition variety (dissolve, cut, fade)
- ELS-to-LS-to-ELS shot arc for epic feel
